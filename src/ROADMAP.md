# pgbun Long-Term Strategy and Roadmap

## Introduction

pgbun is a high-performance PostgreSQL connection pool and proxy built with Bun and TypeScript, inspired by PgBouncer. It provides efficient connection management, PostgreSQL wire protocol support, and configurable timeouts for modern JavaScript/TypeScript environments. This document outlines a strategic roadmap to evolve pgbun into a production-ready, feature-rich tool for scalable database proxying. The strategy focuses on three key long-term directions derived from the project's current capabilities, limitations, and potential expansions.

The roadmap is divided into phases: Short-term (next 3-6 months, focusing on core enhancements), Mid-term (6-12 months, adding robustness and manageability), and Long-term (12+ months, enabling advanced integrations and ecosystem growth). Priorities are assigned as High, Medium, or Low based on impact, feasibility, and alignment with Bun's performance ethos.

## Current Status

### Implemented Features
- **Core Functionality**: Real PostgreSQL server connections with bidirectional query proxying
- **Connection Pooling**: 
  - Session-level connection pooling (default)
  - Transaction-level connection pooling with automatic release on COMMIT/ROLLBACK
  - Basic statement-level pooling stub (per-query assignment/release)
- **Protocol Support**: Complete PostgreSQL wire protocol implementation for parsing and message creation
- **Configuration System**:
  - CLI interface with comprehensive options
  - Configuration file support (TOML format)
  - Environment variable overrides
  - Configuration validation and dry-run mode
- **Security**: SSL/TLS support for both client and server connections with multiple modes
- **Connection Management**: 
  - Connection timeouts (server_connect_timeout, client_login_timeout, server_idle_timeout, client_idle_timeout) compatible with PgBouncer
  - Automatic idle connection cleanup
  - Graceful shutdown handling
- **Development**: 
  - Standalone binary compilation (~98MB)
  - Docker development environment with hot-reload
  - Comprehensive test suite with load testing

### Current Limitations
- Statement-level pooling is only a basic stub (per-query assignment/release)
- No connection health checks or automatic reconnection
- Limited observability: No metrics, monitoring, or admin interface
- Single-server focus; no multi-database or load balancing capabilities
- No admin interface or detailed statistics

### Completed Roadmap Items
- ✅ Transaction-level pooling with automatic release on COMMIT/ROLLBACK
- ✅ Configuration file support (TOML format)
- ✅ SSL/TLS support for both client and server connections
- ✅ CLI interface with comprehensive options
- ✅ Environment variable configuration
- ✅ Configuration validation and dry-run mode

### Remaining Roadmap Items
- Full statement-level pooling (prepared statements support)
- Connection health checks and automatic reconnection
- Metrics and monitoring interface
- Multiple database/server support
- Load balancing across servers
- Admin interface and statistics

This strategy builds on the completed items and focuses on the remaining enhancements.

## Strategic Directions

### 1. Advanced Pooling and High Availability (High Priority)
   Enhance core pooling mechanisms to support more granular control and resilience, enabling pgbun to handle high-load, distributed PostgreSQL setups. This direction addresses scalability limitations and positions pgbun for cloud and microservices environments.

   #### Key Goals and Sub-Steps
   - ✅ Implement transaction-level pooling with automatic release on COMMIT/ROLLBACK
   - Implement full statement-level pooling (prepared statements support)
   - Add connection health checks (e.g., periodic pings) and automatic reconnection with exponential backoff
   - Support multiple PostgreSQL servers with load balancing algorithms (round-robin, least-connections) and failover detection
   - Introduce query routing based on database/user or custom rules

   #### Phases
   - **Short-term**: Complete statement pooling implementation and add basic health checks
   - **Mid-term**: Add multi-server support with simple load balancing (extend Config for server lists)
   - **Long-term**: Advanced routing, failover clustering, and integration with service discovery tools (e.g., Consul or Kubernetes)

   #### Expected Impact
   - Improved performance in transaction-heavy apps; reduced downtime in HA setups
   - Measurable: Increase supported concurrent queries by 2-3x in benchmarks

### 2. Observability and Administrative Tools (Medium Priority)
   Develop tools for monitoring, debugging, and management to make pgbun easier to operate in production. This includes exposing internal state and allowing dynamic configuration, addressing the current lack of visibility.

   #### Key Goals and Sub-Steps
   - Expose metrics via Prometheus/Grafana endpoints (track pool stats, connection lifecycles, error rates)
   - Create an admin interface (web-based or CLI) for viewing stats, pausing pools, and querying active sessions
   - ✅ Support configuration via external files (TOML format) with validation
   - Add structured logging (e.g., with Bun's console or integration with Winston) and tracing (OpenTelemetry support)

   #### Phases
   - **Short-term**: Add basic stats collection in ConnectionPool.getStats() and a simple HTTP endpoint for metrics
   - **Mid-term**: Develop a basic admin CLI tool and enhanced logging
   - **Long-term**: Full web dashboard, integration with monitoring stacks, and runtime config updates without restarts

   #### Expected Impact
   - Better debugging and performance tuning; easier adoption by ops teams
   - Measurable: Reduce mean time to resolution (MTTR) for connection issues by providing real-time insights

### 3. Security Enhancements and Ecosystem Integration (High Priority)
   Strengthen security foundations and broaden compatibility to attract users from secure, JS-heavy ecosystems. This direction leverages Bun's speed while ensuring compliance and extensibility.

   #### Key Goals and Sub-Steps
   - ✅ Implement SSL/TLS for client and server connections (mode negotiation, cert/key file support in Config)
   - Enhance authentication (e.g., support for SCRAM-SHA-256, role-based access) and add query-level security (e.g., SQL injection proxying if needed)
   - Create compatibility layers for JS ORMs (e.g., adapters for Prisma, Drizzle, or pg module) and query optimization features (caching prepared statements)
   - Explore Bun-specific extensions like WebSocket-based admin or integration with serverless runtimes

   #### Phases
   - **Short-term**: Enhance TLS configuration options and add authentication improvements
   - **Mid-term**: Full TLS configuration and ORM adapters (test with 'pg' dependency)
   - **Long-term**: Advanced security (auditing, encryption at rest for configs) and community plugins system

   #### Expected Impact
   - Enable secure deployments; increase adoption in enterprise JS/TS stacks
   - Measurable: Achieve compatibility with 80% of popular Node/Bun PostgreSQL libraries

- **Medium Priority**: Direction 2, for operational maturity—30% effort.
- **Dependencies**: All build on existing classes (e.g., ConnectionPool, Config); ensure unit/integration tests cover new features.
- **Testing**: Expand tests/ directory with benchmarks (e.g., using Artillery for load testing) and security audits.

## Risks and Mitigation
- **Risk**: Performance regressions from new features. **Mitigation**: Continuous benchmarking against PgBouncer; use Bun's profiling tools.
- **Risk**: Compatibility issues with PostgreSQL versions. **Mitigation**: Target PG 14+; add version-specific protocol handling.
- **Risk**: Community adoption. **Mitigation**: Publish releases to npm/Bun, contribute to Bun docs, and seek feedback via GitHub issues.

## Next Steps
1. Review and prioritize items with contributors.
2. Create GitHub issues for short-term milestones.
3. Set up CI/CD for automated testing and binary builds.
4. Schedule quarterly roadmap reviews.
